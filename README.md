#### 1. Make sure you have python3.9 and pip

#### 2. Install all the dependencies/libraries:

cd django (requirements.txt is under django)<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br>

#### 3. You have to create a file called .env under django

What do we add to the .env file(located under django) <br>
SK=django-insecure-7zi!nx(smfx$z(dx5)^-h@+j7&5d9to0g*=o-)#1e53z*=^l@y <br>
EADDRESS=your_email@gmail.com <br>
EPASSWORD=your_email_password <br>

#### 4. To Run the Program on the local machine:

cd django (this command line moves your current directory to django bc we don' care about boostrap template)<br>
python manage.py runserver (run the server in your local machine)<br>

#### 5. Create an admin role(you don't have to do this!): python manage.py createsuperuser --username admin --email

Jason/Fangsheng create an admin account, so you don't have to do it again! <br>
Here is the log in for an admin <br>
Username: fangshengxu <br>
Password: 123 <br>

This is the https for the admin in our local machine: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin <br>
